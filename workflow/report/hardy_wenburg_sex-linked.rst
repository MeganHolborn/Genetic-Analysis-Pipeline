This graph illustrates variants that diverge from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium on the X chromosome. As a result of the fact that some samples only have one x-chromosome, these will be partitioned and displayed on a second scatter sub-plot.

This divergence was deemed statistically significant, using Plink-2's mid-p adjusted filters.

All variants in red are significantly different from expected Hardy-Weinberg ratios, whiel the variants in grey, are considered in equilibrium.
