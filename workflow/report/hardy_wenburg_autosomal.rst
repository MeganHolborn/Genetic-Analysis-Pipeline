This graph illustrates variants that diverge from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

This divergence was deemed statistically significant, using Plink-2's mid-p adjusted filters.

All variants in red are significantly different from expected Hardy-Weinberg ratios, whiel the variants in grey, are considered in equilibrium.
