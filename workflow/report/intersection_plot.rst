The following graph illustrates a venn-diagram alternative, known as an intersection plot. It illustrates the various 'partitions' or overlaps present within the dataset, according to the nature of the overlap. Each column can be thought of as a specific portion or overlapping segment within a larger Venn diagram, with the line-and-dot notation below the column indicating the groups that share this set of observations.
