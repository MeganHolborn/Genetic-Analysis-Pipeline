# Quick Start

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>First you will need to download a copy of the pipeline to a location where you can configure and execute it. Navigate to our GitHub repository and retrive the latest tag information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Next, you will need to clone a copy of the pipeline to your working environment:</p>
        <code>
            git clone https://github.com/Tuks-ICMM/Pharmacogenetic-Analysis-Pipeline/releases/tag/{{TAG_VERSION_HERE}} .
        </code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Now you may begin configuring the pipeline for use. Documentation on that to follow soon.</p>
    </li>
